### JS Classes and OOP

**Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another**

What is __proto__ in any JS object?

#### MDN definition:

The __proto__ property is a simple accessor property on Object. prototype consisting of a getter and setter function. A property access for __proto__ that eventually consults Object. prototype will find this property, but an access that does not consult Object

```

__proto__: Array(0)
concat: ƒ concat()
constructor: ƒ Array()
copyWithin: ƒ copyWithin()
entries: ƒ entries()
every: ƒ every()
fill: ƒ fill()
filter: ƒ filter()
find: ƒ find()
findIndex: ƒ findIndex()
flat: ƒ flat()

```
